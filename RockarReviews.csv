This is our review : Our local JLR being Rockar Stratford, we went there on a Saturday not quite sure what to expect. 
As soon as we entered the show room we were greeted by a pleasant gentleman who made us feel comfortable. In fairness we didn’t really have an idea of what we wanted or if we even wanted to buy a new car. 
But that gentleman gave us best advice on which trim , what options we needed ( and not wanted ) according to our budget. 
All paperworks, finances , options were clearly explained, changed and changed again by us but the Rockar team was always understanding.
Siam delivered and did the handover perfectly ,so by the time he left I knew everything I needed to know about our new car.
Anyway here we are , enjoying our new Disco Sport HSE and let me tell you something, we are looking forward to upgrading in 3 years with our Rockar Stratford.",5,Rockar

Unfortunately the process was let down when the car was delivered filthy and a full inspection could not be carried out on the bodywork, had I been returning this vehicle it would not have been in an acceptable condition. The first job I had to do was wash the car, not really good enough when buying a brand new car. If the condition had been better I would have without hesitation given a 5 stars review.",4,Rockar
37,Salma ali ,Customer safety not a priority,en,2019-12-01T10:53:13Z,"Buying a vehicle with Landrover is a big NO. I will also be leaving an in depth review on other social media platforms because I’ve had enough of the tactics they’ve used to force me to keep this car which has spent already 5 times getting repaired in less than a year of me having this ‘brand new 2019’ car. I have had the most horrific experience of my life with this brand and this was the first and last purchase I’ll ever make with them. I have been given the run around by the brand since the first time there was an issue discovered with my hybrid Range Rover sport. It is unfortunate that such an established brand treats their customers so poorly. I have emails as proof that Land Rover have rejected my request to reject the vehicle when I was well within my rights to do so. So here goes in March I purchased what I believed to be my dream car, the Range Rover sport hybrid. Come April it started to get a bit hot so I needed to use the AC, unfortunately the AC was blowing out hot air. I tried to book into a Land Rover service center but no one was willing to book me in as an emergency they were all telling me they were fully booked and the earliest availability was 2-3 weeks. Fine, I booked in with Lookers chipperfield who said they usually call me in when they had my slot available I was waiting for day’s and I didn’t receive a call. I then proceeded to complain about them to Land Rover who reassured me that they’re deeply sorry but by that time I managed to book in with Aylesbury Land Rover who called me 2 days later telling me ‘we can’t really tell what the issue is at this point and we don’t have a time frame of when this will be resolved as it’s quite a mess in there’ what?? She basically told me because it’s a hybrid it’s quite complicated under the bonnet, I told her to at least give me a courtesy car and she told me Aylesbury didn’t have any available so I then proceeded to take my car back from them and called the Land Rover Rockar branch where I purchased the car from. I was angry, upset, so many emotions because the AC not working was one problem but to top it off it off the climate screen kept going fully black meaning I couldn’t control it, so everytime it got steamy In the car I was having to open the window instead of use the climate to clear the windscreen. I then decided the people I got the car from are responsible and should resolve this. I sent them my car, they didn’t have a courtesy car for me either so I told them to come and take my car when they do have a courtesy car, that was like 2 weeks later anyways, they took the car for a whole week, kept me updated told me they’d repaired the AC & also the black screen, I was very happy. A few drives later the screen went black again so I had to give the car in for repair ‘AGAIN’ they brought the car back and told me it should be fixed now we did a module update and it should be fine, to my surprise a few days later again the same issue AND let me tell you about a new issue along with the black screen, the car stopped driving in the overtaking lane on the motorway and when i told head of After Sales about this he wasn’t at all concerned however he said he’d look at it. This is a 2019 Range Rover sport hybrid that conked out on the m40 at 11:36pm at night, recovery came and rescued me at approximately 1:45AM, I was standing on the side of the motorway in the freezing cold after midnight in some trees all by myself, I was scared, alone and cold. Yesterday night the exact same thing has happened again to my brother, sister, Aunty and mother who had to be on their way home after rescue. I was told by the head of aftersales at rockar that the cars fuel range software had been updated but my family are stranded in the cold on the m40 regardless. I would also like to add that I asked to reject the vehicle within the 3 month purchase range and he told me I couldn’t reject it because Jaguar Land Rover rejected my rejection. I am heart broken, I’ve never ever received such horrendous careless customer service in my life. They also said If I was to get through with rejecting the car anyways I would have to pay them for all the mileage I’ve used up on it. I don’t know if anyone is reading this but please never ever make the mistake of getting a car with Land Rover ESPECIALLY not a hybrid and do not ever think that these people care about you or your safety because they don’t. They want money and that’s that! Safety is not a priority for Land Rover. I would post screen shots of all emails where I’ve been told that I can’t reject the vehicle but I can’t upload here, if you’re reading do you think It is fair what I’ve had to go through? With a brand new 2019 Range Rover sport? Although I appreciate the kindness shown from head of after sales at rockar Westfield Stratford I am at a loss for words at the insensitivity of Jaguar Landrover. I won’t stop at this, I will use every way possible to tell people about this brand and how safety isn’t a priority to them. Please someone help me, I am paying for a car that is constantly having issues I don’t want this car it’s dangerous, I don’t feel safe anymore and I am scared to drive it. I literally asked them to give me an exchange within the first 3 months and they refused me and forced me to keep a car that is having continuous problems. I have no choice but to take the legal route. Land Rover could care less about customer safety.",1,Rockar

42,Mo Mayet,I had to cancel my order,en,2019-11-25T13:45:28Z,"I placed an order on a new Jaguar XE HSE at Jaguar Rockar at their showroom at Westfield Stratford on Sunday 17th November.

I haven’t purchased a Jaguar previously. I have been purchasing a new car every 2 years and have stuck with well-known German brands, Audi, BMW and Mercedes. My current car is an E Class which I return to Mercedes in December.
 
My daughter has been insisting we change from our normal car choice and suggested Jaguar, so we visited the Rockar Jaguar showroom, had booked a test drive in a new E Pace which went well. When we returned to the showroom, my daughter saw the XE on display and said she preferred that. As I had already had a test drive in the day, to not cause any delay I ordered a new XE without test driving to make the process easier for everyone. The Salesperson was brilliant, very helpful and informative, I chose the different payment method and we chose 14th December for delivery as this came up as an option when I paid the deposit. We left the showroom and my daughter was delighted that we had finally switched to Jaguar.
 
On Monday 18th November, I received an email from Rockar Customer Support saying the car will be ready 28th November, what time can I collect the car? I replied explaining I am in the UAE attending the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, do I have to take delivery on 28th?
 
I later received a reply to say “As your vehicle the additional stock support discount, you would need to take delivery before the 9th December”.
 
I have now replied and cancelled my order as I think their behaviour is shocking, I ordered the car one day earlier, chose a date that they gave me as available and now they can’t deliver on that promise. I was supposed to be in Qatar on the 14th of December to watch the Club World Championships, on Sunday evening after ordering the car, I changed my travel plans and paid for a change to my flights, now flying to Qatar on 15th December.
 
Jaguar Financial services have completed a search on my credit file which lowers my credit score, this should never have taken place if you can’t deliver the car as promised, no need for a credit search to be completed.
 
Rockar Customer Service called me on Tuesday 19th November to find out what has happened, and to say he can arrange for the car to be delivered as originally promised. When I explained I was very unhappy with what had happened he acknowledged mistakes had been made but failed to understand why I was so unhappy and why I still wanted to cancel. I thanked him for calling, but unfortunately one day too late in my opinion. The two customer service agents emailing me should have picked up the phone and called me but didn’t, they thought it is acceptable to give me an ultimatum via email. I explained, I can’t purchase a car from a dealer who have started my experience this way and I was very upset over the whole situation yesterday evening.
 
I have been purchasing new cars every 2 years for over 20 years now and have never come across this sort of behaviour before, and now I know why I have stuck to the brands that deliver the right customer service.

On Thursday 21st November I had another call from someone at Rockar, he apologised for what had happened and I accepted the apology. 
 
Safe to say I won’t be purchasing a Jaguar now or ever in the future.",1,Rockar

Going to see the car in a busy shopping mall seemed odd.  All the online uploads and more done by the customer over the internet also seemed strange and at one stage I did even call Jaguar UK to check that these guys really were an authorised dealer.  However their focus on the customer was strong and I ended up with a great car at a great price, a very fair valuation on my trade in, and delivery to my door.  Spot on.

It does well at passing on the savings but..

The online process is ok. For me they may have dehumanised the car buying process too much. It wasn’t very clear to me what stage I was at and whether I’d even got the finance approved when I made the order. 

After buying a house, a car is the biggest purchase you’ll make and I’m not sure a luxury car fitted with an easyJet service works for me. I’d like one point of contact at the very least rather than 5 I spoke too at various stages of the order.",3,Rockar

PDI not carried out to standard on the vehicle,. Crack on rare bumper, stone chips on bonnet. 
No, Seven-day driveway Insurance, because JLR offices where close on date of collection, Found out later that this could have been done online through Rockar.
Outstanding JLR Campaign's on the vehicle, which required the vehicle to be booked back in. 
Not all the outstanding campaigns was carried out. Still waiting for After-sales to at least acknowledge my last email in regard to the Outstanding Campaigns. 
Limited range of courtesy cars available. Was entitled for alike for like, but ended up with a Combustion Engine car.

Pricing is completely transparent and when I tried to beat it by seeking competitive quotes from other dealers - the other dealers couldn’t.

Just one small comment, I was told that I would not be able to get a drive away insurance cover because the car was ""registered"", I thought all cars were registered, new or old.

We had been searching for a very specific car for some time. Once we had decided after visiting showrooms, it is at this point that we were made aware of Rockar, through CarWow.  They had a better deal than anyone could match and were still able to select the features we wanted, just as if we were at a dealership.
We still have to get the car, as it is being made. However, we have had regular updates on progress and there is a delivery service, which will take a lot of the hassle out of it when we get to that point.
Having bought a new car a just over a year ago, I was aware of the considerable amount of time the process can take. This seemed very time efficient.
Ultimately, a car purchase is big, whichever way you pay for it. You still need to make sure of the car you want and it's specification. The only way to do this is go and have a look and test drive some, check the guides and reviews, get to understand the price of what you want and deals available.

269,Neve Taylor,Rockar ROCKS!!!,en,2018-06-25T08:00:20Z,"I was recommended Rockar by a colleague after a bad experience at 2 Landrover dealer shops and my the truly exceeded my expectations.  Apart from offering the best deal on the market for my Evoque Dynamic (by a long way) the service I received was exceptional and beyond my expectations.  

Whilst on the phone the car I had chosen was sold to someone else and Holly and Chris went over the odds to find me an even better car, I can't stress how hard they worked to get me my dream car, the service was attentive and honest.  They reached deep in to the business to get the outcome they wanted and I really felt that everyone at Rockar really cared about my outcome!  

The delivery was a dream and handled with expertise, all questions skillfully answered and it was a great experience to take possession of my beautiful new car.

Even my experience with Rockar service team was exceptional when my touchscreen required a small update for an intermittent bug - Lenny was so helpful, going over the odds to help me as quickly as possible and doing a lot of extra leg work behind the scenes to find a solution for me without me having to chase it up - he even called to see how things were a a follow up and to reassure that they are there to help if I need it.

This should be the ONLY way to buy a Landrover.
I'm so grateful for all the effort and care Rockar have shown me - I'm a customer for life!",5,Rockar
