1,debbie egbaran,Service Department,en,2020-02-29T22:16:05Z,"To whom it may concern 
I wanted to make you aware of my recent experience with your service department at Range Rover Lancaster Milton Keynes. If I had to rate the service on a scale of 1-10 with 10 being excellent I would rate them as 0.5 absolutely unsatisfactory service in all areas.
On 17th February I took in my Range Rover ( which I had bought from them in July 2019) with a fault they had repaired already in November 2019 by them linked to the oil filter.
I was asked to leave the car with them and they would diagnose the fault, I was called on Tuesday 18th to say the oil ring needed to be changed and the car was under Warantee so that would cover the fault.
I was told that the car could only be repaired on the week beginning 24.02.20 as the centre was very busy( I completely understood) and hired a car in the interim.
However I called on Tuesday for an update but was told I would receive a call back, I called the Lancaster branch five times but no response and no return call. 
I called several times on Wednesday and once again was told I would receive a call back, when I did get a call I was told the car would be ready by the end of the week and the mechanics couldn’t test drive because of the rare tires( no further detailed information was provided) but that I would get a call back) 
When I didn’t get a call back on the Wednesday, I called back on Wednesday no answer, I called 6 times on Thursday and called 4 different times on Friday no response( this was outrageous) my husband then had to take day off work and drive from Bedford to MK to find out what was happening. I was left very frustrated at this point.
Finally I went on Friday evening to pick the car and found the tires in such a terrible state ( why had the service official not explained clearly the state of the tires I would have obviously asked them to change them there) 
So Saturday I then took the tires to to change and on getting to the mechanic was told the brake pads are in an appalling state as well ( which was not told me in detail my yourself)

I am so disappointed with the service in Lancaster having my car for two weeks  and not explaining to me about the tires and brake pads and being unable to reach anyone whatsoever on the phone to get an update about my vehicle.
Now I’m using the next two weeks to sort out the tires and brake pads. 

I think it is very important that your service department is corrected so no one else needs to go through what I have been through recently.",1,Land Rover

Review for: Land Rover Birmingham North Jardine Motors: 
I drove all the way from London to Birmingham to view a £40K Range Rover Sport this dealership had, and for them to view my Mercedes C63 part exchange. Put a deposit down on the car and agreed a price for my part-ex. 
All seems well so far.. two people lied about the cars previous history, it's now had two previous owners, not one as stated. The money owed back to me for my part-ex over £15k was promised cleared the following day.. still a week later and I didn't have my money. The car was delivered filthy inside and outside. It did not come with a full years MOT which should do under Land Rover approved, sim card reader still does not work, no one has replied to me emails about these complaints since Feb 5th 2020, 3 WEEKS AGO!! No one answers emails or calls. Fiona Wardle and Kevin Andrews obviously are too busy having their staff lie to their customers than resolve people's issues. I've given them 3 weeks to respond and NOTHING",1,Land Rover

My car came in for its first service and needed the balancer shaft replacing. At no point was I kept informed of when I would get my car back. When I eventually did get it back I drove a short distance and the coolant light came on. Topped it up but it’s continued to come on. Called the garage who suggested I pop it in and they’ll check the levels and didn’t sound convinced when I said I’d done that several times and the light was still coming on, only booking the car in when I insisted. Booked a courtesy car weeks in advance, spoke to them the day before to confirm everything only to arrive to discover there was no courtesy car. I am at my wits end with this company. They are shockingly bad and I will not be using them again any time soon.",1,Land Rover

9,SPR,Worst service EVER!,en,2020-02-10T14:21:14Z,"Worst service EVER!
I purchased an ex-Landrover Management vehicle, 2 years ago. The InControl Remote Premium subscription has recently expired and I paid £260 to renew for 12 months. The process in order to complete the licence renewal was appalling. The web site failed to recognise my sign in details. When I called the relevant Landrover telephone number I was given incorrect information. I visited my dealership on 3 occasions who failed to resolve the issue. When it was eventually resolved I had spent over 4 hours on telephone calls , driven over 30 miles and wasted a further 3 hours on site.
My InControl Pro Services is now due to expire. The cost of renewing this service for one year is a further £89. I have decided not to waste any more money with Jaguar Landrover so have chosen to download the latest map and let my account expire. I am able to sign into my account on my tablet and mobile but I need to sign in on a laptop in order to download the latest map to a USB stick. When I try to log in on the laptop the system fails to recognise me. A further 20 minutes on the telephone has failed to resolve the issue.
Don’t get me wrong, I like the vehicle but unfortunately the Customer Service, both central and at the dealership, has been well below the standard I would expect, particularly having spent in excess of £40k with them. I will be changing the vehicle in 12 months time but will certainly not be buying another Jaguar Landrover.",1,Land Rover

I rarely leave bad reviews as they can be so damaging and I have seen the other side of when an unfair negative review has been left.  However, I felt compelled to review my experience with Land Rover as I have genuinley never dealt with a company so bad,   If their complaints department are so busy that they have too many complaints to deal with (not returning any calls/emails over 2 months) then they perhaps need to review quite why they are getting so many complaints.",1,Land Rover
12,Midbamz Suites,I  am utterly disappointed with my…,en,2020-02-03T21:16:58Z,"I  am utterly disappointed with my recent experiences with the land Rover Evoque D180 SE and the customer care received from Land Rover Assistance .

First and foremost I have to say my experience with Land Rover prior to my recent episodes was nothing short of excellent . I owned a 15 plate Land Rover Evoque SD4 Pure Tech 9  for  3 years 11months and it was an absolute delight .I was sorry to let it go after 38K miles on the clock as I had my eyes on the newer sleeker D180 SE  model I..... wish I hadn’t !!!


My first negative experience was when I bought an ex- demonstration D180SE with 330 miles on the clock , as I was about to drive off in my newly acquired car , warning lights of  “all manner”  kept flashing furiously on the dashboard. Alas! I was told the car had to be returned to the factory although I was kindly offered a refund which took almost a week to process ,I had  a couple of doubts but pushed them aside.
I was still enthusiastic , albeit I was toying  with  the thought of  going back to my first love MBenz . I’ve had two in the past and they never let me down, but the allure of the new Evoque was too overpowering.

I opted to go back to the dealership where I bought my previous Evoque, Shukers  in Shrewsbury and they were wonderful. Consequently, i became  the proud owner of a D180 SE Evoque  on the 17th of Jan, I was beyond elated , it only had 50 miles on the clock !!!!
Two weeks in, the transmission light came on and to my horror the car “died” on an A road not too far from home . I promptly called Land Rover assistance and things were fine , car got towed home. But from then on I have had to chase up LRA  with over 19 phone calls , just so that I can move on with my life , get the car dropped off for diagnostics and pick up a short term replacement  car .

Not happy and really disappointed ,not only with the service but that 2 new D180SE Evoques could develop faults . It hardly fills you with confidence and it has got me thinking !


I am truly disappointed",1,Land Rover
13,Zafer Ipekci,Bad bad service experience,en,2020-02-03T01:01:39Z,"Service experience sucks with this company.
Summary: They couldn't figure out what the problem is but a local mechanic shop could. They even charged me 500$ for not finding the problem. I doubt about them even checking it out.

I have a 2013 Range Rover Evoque Pure.
My car was not starting so I got it diagnosed by a third party technician.
I was told that the starter was not working so we got the starter replaced. The starter I bought was a brand new one that was triple tested so that we knew that it was working. But after we got it replaced the car still didn't start.
So I thought that it would be better to bring the car to an Authorized dealer.
One would expect that an authorized dealer would be proficient at what they do.
On December 19 2019 I brought my car to the Land Rover Jaguar of Stevens Creek. I told them what happened and what the problem is. I told them that the starter is newly replaced. These remarks are already present on the service documents that they gave me.
After their diagnosis they told me that the starter was not working and it needs to be replaced. I didn't believe them because of my past experience and because of the fact that it was replaced just yet. So I took the car and brought it to a local mechanic shop.
They checked the car and told me that the problem was not the starter but  positive cable harness to the starter motor. They ordered new parts and replaced it. Right now everything works fine.",1,Land Rover
14,Farah,Worse customer support ever encountered. HORRIBLE,en,2020-01-30T14:50:40Z,"If there was an option to not put a start rating at all, I would have done that. Seriously, this is the most horrible experience I have ever had with customer service (if you could indeed call them that). 

So, we bought a NEW car from Land Rover and two weeks ago we heard a strange noise when we were turning right. The emergency assistance came and said the car needs to go to service right away. So we took an appointment and dropped the car over, and took a courtesy car. We did not hear anything for two days, because they don't feel there is a need for them to notify the customer of what is going on. So my husband calls them, and they say that the front Axle needs replacing. Seriously, until this minute, we do not understand how a brand new car (2020 model) that is literally a month and a half old would need to have the front axle replaced. They said it would be ready in 3 days because ""they have already ordered the part and it will be ready in three days"". Three days later, no word of what's happening with our car. We call again and they say that the steering column needs to be replaced as well. So, at this point, we freak out. We call customer service and raise an official complain. We also call the dealership that we bought the car from in order to try and find some support, assuming that ANYONE at Land Rover will eventually care about the customer, however, unfortunately, we were mistaken. The customer service representative at the dealership where we bought the car calls the service workshop where our car is, and to our surprise, they say that the only thing that needs replacing is the driveshaft (that's new information for us). I am sure that by now you understand how frustrated we are. The car has been with Land Rover since the 21st of January 2020, and they tell us a different story every time. Even when the customer service person responsible for our case gave us a call, all she said was that we should have not taken the car to the dealership that we have (which is still Jaguar Land Rover), we should have taken it to the one we bought the car from. Keeping in mind, they were the ones that booked the appointment based on what was available at the time. So, instead of trying to offer us any type of support, she was actually very blunt and did absolutely nothing. 
Finally, my husband tries to explain that we are extremely frustrated at this point (rightly so), and that we want to look at options for getting a more reliable vehicle, and the only response that we got was ""well, you were kept mobile when we had your car"" and that they are doing ""everything"" they can to fix it!
This is absolutely horrible. Jaguar Land Rover's customer service is the worse we have had to deal with. They gave us a car that is an older model than ours, extremely dirty and reeks of cigarette smell. Keeping in mind I use this car to drive my kids to school. 
We have been promised (for like the fourth time) that our car will be available on Tuesday (that's in 2 working days). So we still have to wait and see what they have been doing with our car for all this time and to 'hopefully' get a report that is authentic about what was wrong with the car. 
I am just appalled at the minute. I really don't know what to do. So I am writing this long review to just warn anyone who plans to buy a car from Jaguar Land Rover, for your own sake, think twice! They are horrible at customer service, and if our 2020 brand new discovery sport needs that much work only after a month and a half, then I really don't know what to say.

We have been with Land Rover Insurance for 19 years - same vehicle - one small claim  .  We recently contacted Land Rover insurance to let them know that we would be having work done to our Defender and that it would be housed at a different address (workshop) while work was carried out by a qualified Land Rover specialist.  We did everything properly and honestly. They charged us for letting them know...  When the work was complete - again, we did everything properly and contacted them. We were shocked to be told that our insurance had run out weeks ago... and we were without insurance - they had written - not to us - but to the Defender - at the work shop - to let it know that they would no longer insure it due to it's age.  We're very fond of our old Land Rover and it's a fantastic vehicle - but it can't open letters, it can't read - and it bloody well doesn't pay it's own insurance premiums !!!  We had been uninsured for weeks.  We were lied to by everyone we spoke to at their call center (including management) while they continually tried to change their story to cover up the fact that they had messed up.  They tried to blame us - they tried to blame each other and at no point did they treat us with anything like the respect we deserved as longstanding customers.  If this is the way in which Land Rover Insurance conduct it's business - god help anyone who finds them self in a situation where they need to call on them in crisis.  We have received a letter of apology - not a very gracious one.  I, personally would have left out the bit about it being 'the customer's responsibility to insure a vehicle'  It seems we are also to receive a cheque for £50 as an apology for an administrative error...  I would suggest that some staff training might be in order - starting at the top.  I would also suggest some thought should go into re-branding this business.   Land Rover Defenders don't die - 75% of all Defenders built are still on the road.

Dear Sir/Madam, My car was hacked and burgled between Wednesday night (27/11) and Thursday AM (28/11) just in front of my flat’s windows without the alarm going off. The incident was reported to the police (case number:2533175/19). Few items were stolen and I am writing to claim for them back: Pair of sunglasses Tom Ford in the sunglasses compartment (£235 on Tomford.co.uk). Pair of Sunglasses Rayban in the glovebox (£121 Justin model on sunglasshut.com)TP link portable WIFI located in the console (£65 on Amazon)Total £421As a manufacturer JLR have the responsibility to sell a product fit to purpose. In that case, the car should be locked securely and hackers should not be able to get into my car to steal my belongings without breaking a window! This is not an insurance claim but a quality claim as the car is under warranty and this should not happen! The Police said that I should keep my keys in a metallic box to avoid this kind of incident. This was never mentioned to me when I bought the car from Jaguar which I can understand... this is not a great selling point! To my knowledge, this is not also in the instructions manual. I also like my car to be checked ASAP for free and will need a courtesy car. Only a few hundred pounds were stolen but the car could have been stolen in the process. This would have been far more costly!Finally, as compensation for the disturbance, I am not asking for any money but just my wheels to be refurbished when you will check the locking/alarm system. This is more than reasonable considering what I had to go through in the last few days. I have been a very happy Jaguar customer up to now and I am due to change my car in 18 months (looking at a potential F Pace). Depending on the outcome of this claim, I will revisit my options as you can imagine. Thanks in advance for your help.Best regards.Brice Ferret",1,Land Rover

I emailed them over 10 days ago; had an auto-response promising a reply within 2 working days; chased them after that; was left a voicemail message (on my wife's phone for some reason) on day 5 promising me they would assign my case soon and I would get an update on Thursday (day 10).  It is now Friday and I still haven't had anything back from Land Rover Customer Services, despite trying to contact them towards EOB Thursday.  Do they have a reputation for not meeting their promises or am I unreasonable to expect a company like Land Rover to do what they say they are going to do?

I am sitting here reading the comments from others and I realise that I am far from alone with having issues with Land Rover Customer Services.  It is shocking that a company such as this appear to be struggling so much with basic stuff like build quality and customer service.  They sell what is perceived as a premium product at premium prices.  They need to get the basics right!",1,Land Rover

Service intervals on the computer all over the place

But I still liked the car and come to terms with it being a sluggish car! 
After 6 months the car started making an horrendous squeaking noise after taking it back to the garage twice we have been told it’s a common fault and there’s nothing they can do about it so we have to live with it! Apparently it’s what they use to make the break pads !!! 
After filling numerous complaints and being told that most cars do it, it’s the cold weather , it’s the hot weather, it’s how many miles you have done (6500k in over a year) 
It’s the way we drive, it’s manufacturers issue, you will need to speak to Land Rover, literally every excuse possible and still have a very expensive car that squeaks, it’s embarrassing and they have clearly sold and are selling faulty items!!

As expected 3 days have passed and I have received no reply so I thought I’d share the experience to potential new clients of JLR. My heartfelt advice would be if you are thinking of buying one of their products, don’t. Life is too short if something goes wrong (which it undoubtedly will.) this is my third or fourth disastrous  experience so I can only conclude it is endemic rather than a bad one off. Buyer beware. 

Dear sirs,

I have recently failed in contacting you directly on your customer service hotline due to being kept on hold for half an hour. This is unfortunate as my call was regarding your branch networks inability to ever return calls / emails / anything really. Is it part of the Jaguar Landrover DNA? Treat them mean keep them keen? It doesn’t work! 

The real purpose of my call was twofold. Having had the most deplorable customer experience at lookers battersea, I recently took the decision following a problem with my car that the prospect of having to deal with them again was too much so my vehicle was taken on the hours drive to where it was purchased, hardwoods of Croydon. The vehicle has had a leaking windscreen and water ingress had sodden the carpets and seats. I was advised the nearest appointment was over a month away (ridiculous) so I contacted JLR assist who attended the vehicle on 26th October 2019 and suggested this was a common problem, arranged a courtesy vehicle to be available on 28th October. I took the vehicle on the 28th October and their investigation did show a leaking front windscreen and told me the internal carpets needed to be replaced. I was subsequently informed that the carpets were now on back order but as my case was labelled critical, they should be expedited. I have made 8 seperate enquiries since that time, to which all were answered the same way, I’ll speak to service and get back to you. This of course has never happened. Today in order to renew my temporary parking permit I was forced to once again make contact with hardwoods customer service. That in itself has taken 6 phone calls, two emails and 25 minutes on hold. This was just to get an email to extend resident parking permit. I was also assured an update would be forthcoming regarding the likely arrival of the carpets as my car one month on,  lies deconstructed in your workshop. Alas by end of day the update was unavailable, and it was suggested I try you direct. So if somebody somewhere could advise me whether the Carpet back order for my car will take further days, weeks, months or years to repair I would be eternally greatful? 

I made another phone call today regarding servicing my robot lawnmower. There too the service department were unavailable but I was told someone would call me back. The difference however was that within 5 minutes someone did call be back, equipped with all the details I required. If a garden centre can do it, you’d hope that a global luxury car brand would have the dealership capability to put customers at the forefront of their offerings? It really is that poor.

I look forward to hearing back from you, hopefully with answers to my question and perhaps a set of solutions as to how one gets customer service at your dealership network.",1,Land Rover

42,Liz Palfrey,I have recently handed my Range Rover…,en,2019-11-22T15:07:05Z,"I have recently handed my Range Rover Evoque Convertible back after the finance had ended. I had every intention of keeping the car, however during the last 9 months I have had a recurring problem with the car and Land Rover and Colchester Range Rover's dealerships customer service has been appalling leaving me with no option but to hand the car. Every time I visited an area within proximity of a certain radio mast in Colchester my Range Rover either wouldn't turn off, wouldn't lock, wouldn't unlock or would not start. It could take me up to 90 minutes to get into my car and on several occasions I had to have the car recovered. When initially speaking to Range Rover Colchester I was told they were aware of the problem with the radio mast but there was not a specific fix, all they could offer was a system update - this did not resolve the issue. My complaints to Range Rover Colchester continued and I was constantly told the same thing, there was not a fix. 
I was then invited into Range Rover to look at purchasing a new car - obviously one of my first questions was 'will I have the same problem with a new car as I am with my Evoque to which the answer was YES! 
When the finance was due to expire I decided to hand the car back rather than purchase it as the issue with the radio mast could still not resolved, (this particular part of Colchester I visited on a daily basis for work or to attend the gym).
I then contacted Land Rover Customer experience centre to express my frustration with the whole situation and this is when the appalling customer service stepped up a notch - they have not accepted any responsibility but instead tried to blame every pother person and his dog for the fault. Every time I have made contact with them I have received a different excuse, a different story, nothing adds up and no one is taking responsibility, I have not received so much as an apology. The last email I received from the Customer Experience Centre informed me they were closing my case and if I wished to continue with my complaint I needed to appoint a solicitor.

I informed one of the service advisors, Shauna Mullen, of my complaint with the dealership to which I was reassured as a ""gesture of good will"" that they would resolve a loose turbo pipe and non-heating electric seats. 

Upon collection of my vehicle, I was to discover my car in a filthy state which evidently had not been cleaned. Additionally there were no staff available under services department which was extremely disappointing. Reception, instead appointed general sales manager, Luke Tibbles who informed me all error codes in diagnostics were clear and that there were no problems with the vehicle despite my seats not heating, turbo not functioning and a new airbag light being displayed. Upon reasoning with Luke, his answer to me was ""What the f' do you want me to do about it?"" 
He had no clue how to handle the situation or talk with due diligence and respect and I wasted 2 hrs of my time in this dealership. 
I have complained to head office who have dealt with my situation and appointed me to a new dealership where my issues would be resolved. They informed me they would be writing a letter of complaint to the slough dealership.  
I would strongly advise anyone to stay clear of this dealership and especially from Mr Luke Tibbles and Miss Shauna Mullen.

The rudeness and arrogance I found with these people is incredible. See below
Dear Sharon  your ignorance, arrogance and rudeness is astonishing. You refused to put me through to your line manager to discuss the issues with my vehicle. You claim that the vehicle has been in twice and there have been no faults found. I have never heard so much rubbish in all my life. The first time the car was in for multiple electrical issues, I was advised by the service manager and was shown that the car had 22 electrical faults. After my car being in the dealership for a substantial period of time, they cleared the faults but could not get them to reactivate. Clearing faults by a computer does not resolve the problem!! They stated they could not find the problem. These faults continues and I visited the dealership on numerous occasions. Last week, the final straw was when the cars seat crushed me in between it and the steering wheel, then proceeded to move to the fully extended position and thereafter, recline. For this to happen during a thunderstorm and torrential rain created a huge health and safety risk and a huge potential for an accident. Your Landrover assistance attended the vehicle at my home. When the technician plugged the vehicle in, it showed multiple CAN Bus faults. This clearly demonstrates volatile voltage readings. This is exactly why the vehicle was taken immediately to the dealership. For you now to state that there were no faults found on both occasions is incredible. I therefore insist you escalate this matter urgently to your executive team. In the meantime, I will post my findings on Trust Pilot.",1,Land Rover

1. When searching for a new car I was openly frowned upon when in JLR sales centre Exeter must note I’m wearing holiday casual clothes. At the time I didn’t pay it attention but did happen in other sales centres less obviously. 
2.  Purchased new LR Discovery Sport (2017) LR Salisbury. Car wasn’t prepared for road correctly. 3 x tyres still overinflated from storage, car mats not fitted etc. Although minor, what else wasn’t done? I realised this over a month later. 
3. Post purchase door rattle fix. LR Guildford  told rattle is most prominent on a warmer day when driving on a slight right hand bend. 
Garage tested vehicle with 4 x left turns in slow moving traffic. 
4.  While you wait service in LR Swindon???  After nearly 5 hour wait, also completely ignored in showroom, but did notice you got coffee if you wore a suit, to find valet hadn’t happened and items for attention hadn’t been passed on. Complained to LR UK, who simply passed issue back to service centre. LR Service Centre left voicemail asking is there a problem??
5. Time to renew with LR Salisbury. Several emails unanswered and promises we’ve been calling. Yet no missed calls

Here is an email I sent them explaining my issue.  No Reply from their Customer Relationship Specialist despite leaving messages every day for a week.

I am writing you in hope of getting my issue resolved satisfactorily and quickly.  I am the owner of a 2014 Land Rover Evoque purchased in December 2017 with 27,000 miles.  In the less than 18 months, this vehicle has require more than $15,000 in repairs, including replacing the turbo on 6/13/18.  Less than a year later (June 1, 2019), the turbo has failed again.  I brought the vehicle in to Land Rover North Scottsdale and was told that the turbo is only guaranteed for 12 months if I paid for it.  If Land Rover paid for it (which they did), they tell me there is no warranty which is ridiculous.  The service/part should be guaranteed for 12 months regardless of who pays for it.

The turbo failed June 1st about the same time I brought it in to Land Rover North Scottsdale.  At that time, they informed me that I would have to pay for the diagnostic check ($175) and that Land Rover would be covering the repair.  I picked up the car and called Customer Relations.  To this day I cannot understand the reps name, but it is hard to understand.  Regardless, her direct line is 801-887-6430.  To have this person assigned as a customer relations specialist is quite frankly a joke.  I cannot recall the last time I have received such awful service and follow-up.  I called her shortly after bringing the car back home.  She called me after a few days (while I was on vacation in Curacao).  She told me it was necessary to bring the car back in  and have it diagnosed so they can determine it is in fact the turbo.  I explained I was in Curacao until 6/13, but would make an appointment and bring it in the day after we returned.  The car was brought in on 6/14.  They had it for a week and told me that they were working with your customer relations department.  The customer service rep called me on 6/19 asking if I have had a chance to bring the car in.  I informed her that it was brought in on 6/14 and that they have no had it for 5 days.  On 6/24, Land Rover North Scottsdale tells me that corporate wants to do further diagnostics to the tune of $750 (removing valve cover) and suggesting the failed turbo may ne the result of a missed oil change. What???  On 6/24, I call the customer relations specialist to tell her I am not happy being asked to pay another $750 in what appears to be an attempt by Land Rover to avoid responsibility.  She tells me my service advisor (Alan) was out until 6/27, but she left a message with the service director (Robert) and would call be back later in the afternoon or next day.  I receive no call later that day or next day as promised on 6/25.  I call her in the afternoon and ask for an update.  I get no return call.  Wednesday, 6/26 comes and goes with again no call.  I call her again on 6/27 and request a call asap.  I express my displeasure with not being called back as promised and suggest she have her supervisor call me if she is too busy.  No call.  I call again on Friday, 6/28 and again express my displeasure at the lack of follow-up.  This time, I tell her if I do not hear back from her by end of day, I will be contacting Land Rover’s executive offices so here we are.

Whoever this individual is representing Land Rover’s customer relations department is not doing her job or representing Land Rover in a positive light.  I am extremely disappointed in this entire experience and trust you will help me to get it resolved to my satisfaction and expediently.  If not, I will be sure to share this experience with all of my North Scottsdale friends and business colleagues.  This treatment is just not right and no customer of any make should be required to pay for a turbo system that cannot even last 12 months.  If you are not the correct individual to handle this, I would appreciate it if you would point me in the direct of someone in senior management who is.

I have attached a pdf of all the repairs the car has required since we have had it, as well as, the most recent diagnostic report.

Just as soon as I left the dealership I was told that Zaman the Sales person would call me on the Monday to see how I was getting on and whether I was able to connect my car to the phone app, as they couldn't at the dealers.....surprise no call! Not only could I do this but the DB stereo didn't work well and more importantly the air con just blew out warm air.

It has caused me a massive amount of anxiety and frustration considering I spent nearly £50k on a car.  They were keen on taking my money but the after care has been horrendous. 

I ordered a brand new evoque 2019 from A Landrover dealership and they said it would take 3 months to build.  2.5 months went by with no update on the progress of my vehicle.  I rang my sales advisor on a fortnightly basis to see what the progress was and whether there were any updates on my order. She replied back with the same answer each week “No nothing yet, no updates or any news”.  Basically fobbing me off and saying wait your 3 month time scale which was given. 

I raised a complaint with JLR and the following day I received a call from the dealership to say my order has been cancelled and they have had to reorder the vehicle again. This would take another 3 months!!!.  Overall I would have to wait 6 months in order to receive my vehicle.

The dealership and JLR both arrogantly refused to compensate me for the delay in my ordered vehicle saying it was not their fault the vehicle was cancelled due to factory technical issues. They were very vague in explaining what the cancellation reason.  

I have had to lease a car out for these past 6 months due to needing the vehicle for my business, which has resulted me in a massive financial loss.  Yet JLR are unable to lend me a courtesy car until my vehicle has been built.

I am now chasing them again because, guess what, they didn't contact again.  WHY should I have to chase this down myself?  I have raised a complaint, the dealer is so hopeless they cannot respond and JLR think it's acceptable to just leave it at that?  

The issues were 1) known design defect causing high level brake like to leak.  They won't replace under warranty.  So my 4x4, go anywhere vehicle leaks when it rains.  Do they really think this is acceptable?  2) the car was dangerously slow pulling away from junctions, nearly got hit twice in side collisions it was so bad.  So they updated the software and charged me for that, even though the car was under warranty.

Problems from start to finish with the newly purchased Velar and the attitude of the Birmingham (Tyburn Road) dealership due to lack of communication from Chantel and her 'Service Manager' Charlotte Diadio is appalling!  

The vehicle warning light came on in London and the vehicle has now been in Land Rover Birmingham for 8 days, Chantelle failed to return my call on Tuesday but did confirm to my partner the following day that the vehicle would be delivered to his home address on Wednesday in Birmingham.  As I am London based and was traveling back from the Middle East on business I returned to Birmingham from London to find the vehicle hadn't been returned as promised and no further phone calls had been made to us both to confirm why?  After 3 phone calls to Chantel the following day she finally took my call, I was advised that the vehicle was on route the previous day but the fault reappeared.  Some reason she thought it was ok not to call us to let me know?  I have now had to cancel today's meetings and have additional costs for this unnecessary trip from London to Birmingham where I work during the week.  I have now been offered an old courtesy car by the Service Manager that they will get to me 'when they can' and I have been given a time window.

As you can understand I'm not particularly happy with this but understand this can happen so I discussed it further with the 'Service Manager' to establish if we can meet some expectations for the return of the vehicle due to business commitments.  Firstly Charlotte would not take ownership of her colleague's lack of communication and just replied I will discuss it with her.  When asked can I have an idea of the return of my vehicle she just bluntly refused any time scales without even asking the repairs team?  The general attitude towards client experience is nonexistent with Charlotte and surprise someone with a lack of customer engagement can be classed as 'Management' and represent the Land Rover brand.  I have purchased a costly Range Rover Velar and can say between Strastone and Land Rover I may have experienced the worst customer journey of my life - If I could hand this vehicle back now I would without any hesitation!!!

We purchased a Range Rover last Feb and within 1 month we had brake issues.  It took the garage 6 weeks to book in the car to replace the pads, 6 weeks later we had the same fault and yet again it took a further 8 weeks before the garage could fit our car in for yet another set of brakes. Later that year we noticed a small judder when driving I called the Stratstone Hanley Branch to book in my car for a service and informed them of the issue they said we will look at this but we can't fit your car in for 10 weeks..!! Before the car went in for a service the fault got worse and the car became unsafe.  We ended up calling Land Rover Assist only to be told that we now had a prop fault.  After complaining to the garage about the number of faults in our first 12 months they informed us that they could only keep repairing the car they would not refund our money. The dealership said that we would have to report this to Black Horse Finance (Range Rover Finance).

We did so and a lady Rachel Roberts investigated the problem and eventually concluded that the dealership had resolved all the issues and offered me £250 as a compensation offer for the fact that the car had spent over 9 weeks in the garage within 12 months of purchase.  The lady concluded that having two sets of brake pads within a few months was ok for a Range Rover. I did not take her offer but because we needed the car we had to take the car back. Range Rover confirmed that all the faults were now fixed. Two days after collecting the car the fault reappeared so we called the dealership only to be told that Stratstone had sold out to Rybrook and they would not assist!!!  We called Black Horse only to be told the case was now closed as we did not except the £250 offer.  After calling and emailing the head of each dealership we eventually got the car back to the garage only to be told that the car had 3 buckled wheels and this was causing the issue, (although the garage had kept the car for 4 weeks and had also completed a full service) we asked why they had not picked this up sooner and they say they weren't sure!!!.  The wheels however were not covered under manufactures warranty therefore we would have to pay for new wheels.  I refused due to the fact that the wheel issue must have appeared before we purchased the car as the brake issue was linked to the wheels..!!  We argued for 3 weeks before the dealership agreed to rectify the fault for free.  We received the car back but the wheels were not changed they were still the original set.  I called the garage and they said that they had managed to repair the faults without changing the wheels. 

Two weeks later the judder came back and we had to call out Land Rover Assist as over 4o miles the car felt unsafe to drive, once again the engineer said that the car would require to go back to the garage as it was not driving correctly.  Land Rover assist said that they would report this to the dealership and someone would contact us. A week passed and nothing happened, we called Black Horse and they said they could not do anything as this was a new fault although still linked to the driver comfort.!!  We said that we would like them to return our money less payments made and they could take their car back, they refused.  

We are still chasing the garage to collect our car but since last week we no have an alarm on the dash saying the brakes require to be changed!!!! I am sure any intelligent person (who is not a car mechanic) can see having 3 sets of brake pads in the first 12 months is not normal.!! Although Rachel Roberts at Black Horse believes all these faults are not linked.!! My advice is to keep clear from Black Horse, Range Rover and Strastone.  The garage gave me a loan car, which was a Ford Fiesta and it was a far superior car to the Range Rover and was totally gutted when they gave me back the range Rover..!!",1,Land Rover

The service dealer Lancaster Tonbridge say they can't fix the problem despite the fact this is a known issue with the brake booster. Lancaster arranged for JLR to send a Field Engineer on 1st April (I should have known) to resolve. A few days before anticipated date received a call from Lancaster saying FE had to cancel as called to an urgent meeting in Coventry. JLR would however advise a new date w/c 1/4/19. Have since been advised by dealer FE are currently confined to Coventry? Called JLR Customer Experience to try and find out when someone would look at the car. Since then numerous calls to JLR. Each time advised matter is with the Technical Dept of JLR. I'm only asking for two things (1) when will the FE visit the dealer to look at the car (2) Why the FE appear to be not making dealership visits?? Communication from JLR zilch.

91,Andrew Baker,"Nice car, pity they can't design and build them properly.",en,2019-04-29T11:51:14Z,"Bought a used ""exceptional"" Disco 3 on impulse despite reading the horror stories - I knew it was a mistake. I have done 2000 miles in it since buying and it has let me down twice in that short time. First, all power was lost which turned out to be an EGR valve (£400) then the fuel cap wouldn't open and then broke in half at the garage so couldn't refuel.  Arrived late at Gatwick after swapping cars to collect my partner who flew back from the US and was stranded waiting for me.  Ok so the car is 10 years old but what hope is there if they can't even make a reliable fuel cap ?? Apparently the fuel filler door also gets jammed solid....

The build quality of the interior is poor, lots of cheapo squeaky plastic, worse than a 20 year old mitsubishi van we use. Disco drives well but there's always a nagging feeling that it will dump you somewhere horribly inconvenient and cost a large pile of money, time and grief to sort out. 

I owned a Defender 110 tdi for 150,000 miles - never a problem despite 5 African desert trips as far as Niger -- all off road plus daily useage - simple robust engineering. 

In fact I have just bought another 22 year old one to refurbish for more desert trips, such is my faith in the basic nature of the machine.

I did think long and hard about using the Disco for such trips but the poor design of certain systems, eg: handbrake cable motor which is supposed to be cleaned after 50 miles of off road use !!!, the electronics controlling the air suspension, the similarly under specced air compressor (now supposedly more robust) that overheats and goes into sulk mode leaving you without any suspension until it cools down, meant that taking it outside of Europe was a major red flag - in fact even outside the UK. Even having a blown brake light bulb can mean that the whole car goes into limp mode !!!

Discos are hideously complex (new ones more so). The fact that they are neither designed or built properly combined with a high degree of complexity that main dealers are usually stymied by problems. Just read the reviews (Land Rover Hell) - there's no smoke without fire.

Current Land Rover management has lost the plot and should have kept things simpler, stop chasing Chinese and US profits and focus on quality.

Do they ever look at what other car manufacturers are doing ? If they don't, they should. If they do, they don't see.

The new Defender is going to repeat the sad cycle of over complexity and poor quality. Good luck going to Niger in one of those. 

I can't help thinking that the Land Rover management of the 50's for example wouldn't have been quite so gormless.

My advice - don't. Buy something else....",2,Land Rover

Absolutely shocking customer service at CMH Land Rover Cape Town!

Disgusted by their care. Land Rover you should be ashamed of yourselves!!!!!

On 13th February 2019 I  bought a brand new 2019 Discovery Sport 2.0 i4D SE from CMH Land Rover Cape Town. I initially had problems after just 4 weeks with the stop start , voice control system and HDMI/USB Port and inform the sales person.
The car went in numerous times for this but up until today the stop start and HDMI/USB  still not fix.
I was told that they will contact me when the car is ready but I had to contact them numerous times to find out what’s happening.
After calling them all day I went to the garage to fetch my car & I had to wait for 45+minutes only to find out that  the problem was still not fixed . 
I was told that I need to bring the car back whenever I can.

This is so disappointing!
So disgusted by their care!!
Worst After Sales Service Ever!!!

The sales person Jacques Windell is brilliant.

I hope you agree with me that this is not acceptable under any circumstances. I trust that you will deal with this issue in a top urgent fashion. I also trust that you will take the necessary precautions to prevent such incidents in the future.

Awaiting a response a.s.a.p. as this is an URGENT MATTER.

I have owned the car for 18 months and now the car has covered 22k miles and it has 16 months manufactures warranty left. 
been in to land rover bishops stortford 3 times on the last visit was when driving on the motorway the bonnet latch broke on the offside and the bonnet flew up they changed the latch under warranty and when i picked car up they adjusted the bonnet SHOCKING it is twisted I said emm thats all we can do.
so I called land rover uk they said go to land rover Hatfield they have had the car for 1 month and now said that its not covered under warranty 
this is what they emailed me.
Thank you for taking the time to raise your concerns with the Customer Experience Centre.  It was disappointing to learn of the issues you have experienced and on behalf of Jaguar Land Rover I would like to apologise for any inconvenience or frustration caused.  
 
After reviewing the concerns raised relating to the bonnet latch and gear box I can confirm that unfortunately, neither Land Rover Bishops Stortford or Grange Land Rover were able to identify a fault with the gear box therefore both retailers have been unable to carry out any any actions to rectify any concerns. In relation to the bonnet latch, regrettably as there is evidence of significant modifications on the vehicle in that a non Jaguar Land Rover approved Urban Body Kit has been fitted, we are unable to account for any concerns that may have arisen as a result of these non approved modifications. Therefore, we will not look to support with the costs of the repair as there is no evidence to suggest that this is a result of a manufacturing or material defect. 
 
You have also mentioned that you purchased the vehicle from Alexander Prestige and the urban body kit was already fitted to the vehicle, however this is not a Jaguar Land Rover approved retailer and we did not manufacture the vehicle with these modifications fitted. With this in mind, Jaguar Land Rover would not be able to account for the history behind the vehicle or account for any work or modifications that have been carried out on the vehicle by external, third party companies. 
 
Should you have concerns with the condition of the vehicle that you have purchased and any modifications that are present on the vehicle, I would recommend that you raise this with your point of purchase. 
 
It does however remain that the final position of Jaguar Land Rover is that as the concern has not been deemed to be the result of a manufacturing or material defect, we would not be able to provide any financial assistance regarding any repairs required. Should you wish to seek third party independent advice and should we receive contact from your chosen representative, I can assure you that we will respond accordingly.
 
I appreciate that this is not the outcome that you were hoping for, however I trust this has clarified our final stance in the matter. 
Your sincerely.

The entire inside of the car was saturated and the battery was completely submerged under water, which fried the electrics in the car. Not only is the car a lemon but the service we have been afforded by Land Rover has been appalling. We have now been without a car for 6 days with no contact from Land Rover. The dealer to whom the car was delivered is still ‘working through it’. We have not been given a replacement vehicle despite having allegedly been put on a wait list 6 days ago. Now we’ve been told by Land Rover that there is no way they will consider replacing the vehicle albeit the Australian Consumer Law says you are entitled to choose a replacement product if there is a major problem which would stop someone from purchasing the vehicle. Land Rover says water leaking is not a major problem but I’d love to know if there is anyone out there who would buy a $130,000 car which has had water leakage! It is hard to see this as a one off with Land Rover - we had a Freelander a few years ago now and it was a total lemon too but after 10 years had decided to give them another go. What a mistake!

He said ""the internet is a great thing"" basically implying that all the failures were false - somehow with all the back orders I fail to see how they can imply that. In addition he could not confirm if the replacement part (this cost £2350 to fix at the garage) was also made of this - he said he checked with technical people but could not say if it was the same.

Additionally, when braking at the same time, the indicator lights becomes practically invisible. I raised this with JLR who did not see it as a problem. Land Rover were obviously aware of this failing and have ‘quietly’ made a ‘safety enhancement’ to new production Discovery 5’s, where now 100% of the indicator cluster illuminates, which is much better and safer all round. Unfortunately, they decline to retro fix this issue for existing model owners, whose safety, having now parted with their cash, is apparently of no concern .

Again no apology and I had to disrupt my day, drive 15 miles and collect money that was stolen from me by an employee.  Anyhow I told the young receptionist that as it was a crime I’d be logging it with Gwent police, I know but it’s the principle and it won’t get investigated, and I’d tell all I know about the trustworthiness of Newport Land Rover. The poor receptionist could tell I was loosing it and tried to apologise on behalf of the franchise bless her, it wasn’t her place to apologise. After the phone call still nothing from the franchise. I will not use that Newport franchise again as stealing from customer cars seems to be accepted.",1,Land Rover

Its my 5th Discovery and 7th Land Rover so I know all too well what to expect... but the Customer Service is BEYOND appalling. Stop Start not worked for 18 months, something deep within the seat moves under braking and front suspension has a problem where it knocks over bumps. Approved service centre was supposed to fix it all under warranty and materially failed to make any difference whatsoever to any issue (although they were keen to sell me number place bulbs at £18 - I bought them for 25p). Alternative dealers need a six week window to book the car in so I foolishly handed the issue to LR Customer Services who couldn't be LESS interested. Instead of expediting the issue, they dragged their feet until the warranty had expired altogether before telling me that I now had to pay for 'diagnostics'!  

If you are going to buy one of these notoriously problematic machines, you expect some backup from the manufacturer. In this case, they have brilliantly demonstrated that their customer base count for NOTHING. 

The company and its attitude is a disgrace. I rarely lose my temper but the attitude of their customer service people caused me to lose it in a spectacular fashion last week. 

As much as I would love to say support British industry and buy a JLR product, I would advise anyone interested to go elsewhere. A company that respects that you spent £61k on their products and show even a hint of interest in making you buy another.

Discovery Sport boot issue...now fixed I think, until today.  Reversing camera works when it feels like it over the parking sensor which I now know is not right.  Rattles in the dash which were fixed a week ago, but  this week had to get Land Rover Assist out as the Discovery starts making seriously awful static electrical sounds through the speakers in reverse and then through the whole car and the radio won't turn off even when I've got out of the car!  Did not feel safe. Phone dealer (Guy Salmon Ascot), who say the issue is not connected to having the rattles fixed. As the waiting list for a loan car is always weeks and weeks away, I can't take in because I wouldn't have a car to drive!   Assist can't replicate the issue when they arrive.  By the way, Assist tried to put it off until the next day (OMG! don't ever break down in the middle of nowhere will you).  Assist can only think that it could be due to heavy rain last night that could possibly be affecting the electrics.  What?!  The car is meant to drive through water, so it hadn't better be.  A shortage of loan cars at the dealer when they have so many indicates there's a catalogue of issues with Land Rover.  A complete disaster purchase only in April 2018 for a 2018 model.  Do not love this car anymore and can't wait to get shot of it.  It's taken up so much of our time.  To add to this, my Husband had problems with his 2016 Range Rover Sport this year whilst we were going to the dealer to place the order for the Discovery of all things.  I think this should have been a sign.  His was a turbo pipe issue that put it into restricted performance (30mph in the outside lane).  That was scary.  Trying to get that sorted was a joke. The service chap (will not be named) could not get anything right and just didn't listen.  The Manager was clearly not interested that we were not getting the service expected.  The sales dept. had to stamp their foot on our behalf as we had a new car on order that we were on the brink of cancelling due to the issues with service.  They managed to change us over to a lovely lady in service that knew what she was doing.  More recently he had an exhaust temperature sensor issue...now fixed.  Not happy customers at all.  His previous model Range Rover Sport turbos went too.  He has to use this vehicle for the type of work he's in, but I will most likely go back to BMW for my next car for better service response time.

I’ve now owned 6 Land Rovers, 3 new and 3 near new, over the last 7 years and traveled more than 250,000 miles in them and the support I’ve received from them has, on the whole, been excellent.
Apart from a new version of infotainment software, which took a while (with minimum inconvenience to me) and one Disco being off the road for 4 weeks while a faulty fuel pump was diagnosed and fixed, they couldn’t have been more helpful.
The 4 week fuel pump delay (during which time they gave me very nice loaners) resulted in them offering me a very large subsidy to buy the new Range Rover of my dreams “just for the (negligible) inconvenience caused”.
I pay my own money for my cars and I’d be uncomfortable about placing such a large amount of trust in anyone other than these people.

21/9/18 Update:

Gosh, what a difference a few months and a shambles makes :(

My first major problem has seen my £104,000, 10 month old, Full Fat Range Rover off the road for 31 consecutive days with an engine problem, with no indication of when it will be repaired.

I have asked for the car to be exchanged, but LR want me to contribute the equivalent of nearly 10 months' salary for the mere 10 months that my Range Rover actually worked!!

Under their Land Rover Assist scheme, LR provided a Disco for 3 days, then the dealer had to step with their own car for 3 weeks while LR tried and failed to find me a loaner of any kind. LR eventually came up with a 4 pot diesel Jaguar on loan, which I will have had for about 18 days before the earliest date that they hope to have a proper Range Rover to lend to me.

I have been the most loyal customer, buying 6 of their cars (three new and three Approved Used) over the last 7 years and have been a huge advocate of Land Rover over all of that time - resulting in several sales of new, or near new, JLR cars. Then, when I really need help, it's all gone to pieces; it's driven my wife to tears, and me to distraction.

9/10/18 Update:

Car finally returned after 44 days in the workshop, awaiting parts and service bulletin from LR. After around 800 miles it hasn't gone wrong again and normality is slowly being restored. It's still an absolutely wonderful car!

I'm still very unhappy about how I was kept completely in the dark until about 6 days before it was returned and their loan car scheme left me with the dealer having to step in and provide their own loaner for 3 weeks and having to fight tooth and nail to get anything from LR and I never managed to get anything remotely comparable to the car that I was actually paying for.

Still, LR are looking into this and I'm awaiting their response on 11/10/18....

16/10/18 Update:

LR have provided a good Will gesture for the inconvenience. It’s not particularly generous, but it could have been worse.

Trying to forget this recent bad experience and move on and now seeing how it goes for the remaining 3 years of my 4 year contract on this car....

Absolutely shocking service, I bought the Evoque SD4 Dynamic from Gordon Lamb Chesterfield (before the dealership was sold to Farnell), the most expensive purchase I have ever made apart from our house, for a luxury brand. 
The salesman and sales manager at the time didn't return calls or follow up on any of my complaints I made in respect of all the many documentation errors made by him, the collection of my new car was literally from the car park, I was told to read my user manual as he didn't know how to work the things inside, and my InControl system was completely messed up after the salesman registered it with another customer, this took several weeks to rectify, predominantly by myself.

The service team have now excelled in continuing to deliver extremely  poor service, I have waited for a week for authorisation on my 4th service, which I have paid for in advance via service plan. I was told quite abruptly by Sandra the service advisor, she had contacted Land Rover several times and it could take unto 30 days to get authorised, ""there is now nothing else she can do."" 
I was told ""If you want to try and contact them, you can to try and get things moving"" but i was offered no contact details or further advice.

Land Rover customer services were excellent and said it had been authorised last week and the Farnell service dept, had basically not done their job and checked the system. 

I am still waiting for an apology for being lied to, the service manager has not responded to my request for a call back.

This company is institutionally poor in upholding the the Land Rover branding and cannot deliver even an adequate customer service, they do however excel in never failing to surprise me with how bad they are.

The product I love, I feel bad for writing a review like this against Land Rover but they should govern their dealerships better.

149,Tanya Lord,Had a nightmare with my Range Rover…,en,2018-10-04T11:12:37Z,"Had a nightmare with my Range Rover Evoque and DPF issues since I purchased the car in March this year. 
Been back and to to Land Rover Hatfield’s Liverpool 5 times since July 2018. 
Land Rover assist have been slow arranging courtesy cars for me each time.
There is an underlying fault on the vehicle with the DPF as it is regularly ‘almost Full’ or ‘full’. Most recently 2 weeks ago driving on the M6 with our 2 young children in the back, the red warning light appeared ( no prior amber warning)  on the dash stating ‘DPF full and restricted performance’. In the outside lane of the motorway the car jolted from 70mph down to 40mph almost causing a serious car accident as the car behind us missed us by centimetres.
We had to drive the car across 3 lanes of the M6 at no more than 40mph in rush hour traffic to get to the hard shoulder and call Land Rover assist to have the car recovered.
Every time the car is in Land Rover Hatfield’s the DPF is just regenerated. 
The AA technician even stated that the DPF needs replacing. 
I have had other electrical problems with the car also and no one at Land Rover wants to be held accountable for it. Management advised my basically to extend my warranty come December when it expires but why should I when the problems are apparent now?! 
It is covered by the warranty but I am totally disheartened with the whole experience and service. 
This is a long story cut short as the whole experience with Land Rover has been terrible. 
Land Rover assist advised that they also do not cover out of pocket expenses so all the leave from work, fuel expenses and phone call costs are not reimbursed at all. Absolutely shocking service for such a large company of so-called luxury vehicles. 
I have raised a formal complaint and a case with the financial ombudsman as the car is not roadworthy and an absolute death trap. I do not trust the car to use it for a motorway journey with my children in it anymore.

- kickplates passenger and driver side broken (still not fixed after 3 attempts)
- heads up display - vibrates when music is played (they claim to have tightened the placement of the heads up display inside the dash, raised a ticket with JLR but still not fixed)

Every time I've received my car back from Listers Solihull, Lancaster Erdington and Marshall Peterborough dealerships they've damaged few other things. 

I consider myself lucky to still be alive to say the very least. The following are only 4 of 20 issues I’ve experienced with my vehicle;

(1) Whilst driving on the motorway at 80mph my bonnet unlatched itself. We are talking about a brand new car which was 7 days old. But when I contacted JLR, Caroline Willis from the Executive Office states “it was in fact a slight misalignment of the bonnet”. How such a serious issue, one which could have caused death and they take it so lightly is ""Above & Beyond"" me. 

(2) I was sold the car with run flat tyres, yet whilst driving on the motorway at 70mph my tyre popped (with no warning on the display; before or after) I was trying to control the car whilst on the alloy wheel (all I could see was sparks from the alloy wheel as it was screeching against the road). I don’t know how but I managed to safely get on to the hard shoulder - contacted Land Rover assist they sent AA to change my tyre. I further emailed the dealership with my complaint; no reply, contacted JLR - no reply.

(3) Whilst driving on the motorway a red warning message appeared ‘Engine overheating’. I contacted JLR was told to take the car to a dealership. The car was recovered to the famous Listers Land Rover Solihull. They carried out a 50 mile test drive (fuel at my expense) and said they couldn’t find a fault with it. I luckily took a picture of the warning message and showed it to the service advisor whom still advised there was nothing wrong with my vehicle. He couldn’t explain why the message was displayed on the screen. They further replaced the centre console drink holder door under warranty and in the process caused more damage; whereby all the metal strips in the centre console are no longer aligned and the sliding door has a 5mm gap when closed. 

(4) On 19/09/2018 (10 days after receiving my car back from Listers Solihull which they had for 15 days) whilst driving on the third lane of the Motorway, I experienced another near death incident. Whilst travelling at 80mph to overtake a vehicle in the 2nd lane, I merged on to the third lane, whilst doing so my car lost all power and the speed dropped down to 20mph. A message on the dashboard read ‘Restricted Performance’ . The vehicle behind me nearly collided in to the back of me, the driver had to swerve in to the left lane to avoid a collision. I quickly switched on my hazards and was left stranded on the third lane with speed restricted to 20mph. Vehicles were having to go past me in the left lane. Once I found it safe to do so, I merged on to the hard shoulder and waited couple of hours for Land Rover Assist to tow me off the motorway. I was towed to Listers Wolverhampton as they was the only dealership who had a Discovery Sport to loan out to me. The AA driver laughed and said “Thanks to JLR the AA are busy”. I think this summed up everything for me. Since I’ve had my vehicle it’s been towed by AA more than several times. 

The level of service received from Listers Solihull, Lancaster Erdington, Marshall Peterborough dealerships and JLR Customer Relations has been dreadful. 
RANGE ROVERS ARE A DEATH TRAP. IF YOU OWN ONE AND DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE ANY PROBLEMS WITH IT, CONSIDER YOURSELF VERY VERY LUCKY. #JLRDEATHTRAP

160,Stephen,Land Rover Customer Service is a joke.,en,2018-08-25T09:45:30Z,"Bought a Range Rover Sport new in March 2018. The day following delivery, having left it in my drive overnight, I noticed water inside the car. The windscreen had to be re-fitted. Shortly after return of the car the alarm sounded at night waking my neighbours and causing the car to notify my mobile phone it was being tampered with. Local dealer originally unable to find fault. The day after the car was returned it happened again. The radio failed on the way to the garage. The radio fault was never adequately explained. The alarm fault was faulty bonnet latch micro switches. All in all the car was off the road for probably two weeks although to be fair the local dealer did lend me a suitable courtesy car and make a goodwill payment.

I travel to Italy several times a year and one reason for changing my old Discovery for the RRSport was to have vehicle recovery and guarantee when abroad. About 50 miles from my destination the engine warning light came on on the motorway and the engine switched off. I managed to get to the hard shoulder, called the roadside assist number and got out of the car with my wife and dog and climbed a bank at the side of the motorway.

I haven’t time or energy to describe the whole horror story that unfolded from here but the call centre staff were absolutely clueless. The Italian police arrived and decided our position was dangerous and called their own recovery truck. From then on we were effectively abandoned by roadside assistance. Our car and we were taken to a dept miles from anywhere. The recovery company offered to take us to a nearby hotel but fortunately some friends came to pick us up and take us to our destination. We had to contact roadside assistance ourselves the next day for un update and chase them repeatedly until they finally located a hire car late that evening again 50 miles away. No transport arranged to get us there so our friends drove me again and I was finally able to get our luggage out of our car over 24 hours after the original incident. It then took another whole day to get our car 25 miles to the local dealer. It was Friday evening so the dealer was unable to look at it until the Monday. The dealer called me on that evening saying the fault was a loose tube and the car would be ready the next day after a road test.

I wrote a complaint to the landroverassist email address. Their response was unapologetic and stated that the assistance provided was adequate in the circumstances. It certainly bore no relationship to that advertised in the Land Rover brochures ( if your car is going to take more than 5 hours to repair we will arrange either a hotel or a transport to your destination). I then escalated my complaint. Don’t waste your time. Land Rover senior management is no more interested than the LRAssist group. None acknowledged my communication personally. I was advised to contact the AA myself if not satisfied! I was told ‘ the case is closed’.

I will never buy another Land Rover and advise you not to either.

They don't communicate with one another and each party blames the other for the lack of communication as Beadles say they are so busy dealing with customers and so is the HQ its difficult to liaise. meanwhile, I am without my new car and fobbed off with a courtesy car that is not suitable for my needs.
I purchased a new Autobiography Range Rover in June that cost over £110,000.
I have had the car adapted for my wheelchair and choose to invest in such a car because I have a rare muscle disease and I'm in severe pain in my spine all the time and it's vital that when travelling I try to keep as comfortable as possible. 
The first 3 weeks the car went back as the bodywork had a poor finish, in the end, we paid a car valeter to sort the problem. A week later the phone system failed which is a real problem as we need to have communication when travelling long distances.
They sent an engineer out who couldn't fix the problem so booked the car into services a fortnight later when a courtesy car became available and they tried for a few days to sort it and couldn't. I was unable to go our as obviously there was no adaptation for my wheelchair. They then booked it in for another 2 days whilst they ran different programs to fix the problem they then telephone us to say all was working well and when we picked the car up the problem had had not been sorted. They have now booked it in again this week for another few days and all I keep getting from Beadles customer service is that they are reliant on their HQ to instruct them and give them the correct program to  sort the problem out and that they also moaned that haven't been paid for the job and don't get paid until its sorted.

165,William Dyer,Land Rover Assistance,en,2018-08-15T15:47:54Z,This is my third Range Rover Autobiography Sport and this is currently on a 66 plate and this morning on my way into work I pushed the gear selector into reverse and the little switch on the gear selector broke and I was stuck in park (it's an automatic). So I hit the emergency button that rings through to range rover assistance and within an hour the first recovery subcontractor arrived and could not help so he left and then an AA recovery truck landed and a perfectly professional engineer took my car away. I then received a call 8 hours later telling me to make my way to Preston to pick up a courtesy car which I explained that was unacceptable because I had already been waiting over 8hours and I am not heading into Preston at 3/4 pm. I was then called back to say it would now be delivered at around 6 pm!! over 12 hours since my breakdown call and I have been waiting all day. When you buy a top of the range car and you are promised an assistance service that you presume will match it is very disappointing when it falls well short of expectations. This fault has also happened on a previous range rover so its a fault range rover has not overcome whilst improving other design elements.,1,Land Rover

It was the worst transaction I have ever made .I had to argue to get two new tyres on the front and the paint work to the bumper had to be done again due to it being a poor standard ,not what I expected from a main dealer  It was supposedly to have numerous checks before I took delivery. When I drove off the low coolant light came on and when I stopped the battery light came on .It developed an oil leak on the back axle and the tailgate only worked intermittently .
I contacted Stratstone and was told they had been taken over by JCT  and I would have to wait five weeks before it could be sorted .They finally started the work and had it just over two weeks..
All in all the Range Rover did  under 1000 miles and was stood more time than it spent on the road.
  I Requested JCT to buy the Range Rover from me knowing that I would lose money they refused saying they had enough stock.
 I have sold it to an online buyer not we buy any car with a loss of £2748 not bad for less than a few days driving .OH one last thing the tailgate stopped working again before the buyers picked it up.
Range Rover should be ashamed of themselves with franchised dealers  like this .

The windscreen wipers failed on a rainy day recently and I had cause to use Land Rover Assist. Apparently the Land Rover Assist contract has recently been won by the AA. The AA were appalling and kept me waiting for two and a half hours to just tighten the nuts on the wiper arms. I suspect that this is the first time the car had been driven in rain since delivery and I suspect that the car left the factory with loose nuts on the wiper arms. Whilst this is disgraceful quality control (and makes me wonder where the other loose nuts on the car may be), this is not my main complaint. The attitude of Land Rover Assist and the AA was not good. These cars cost a lot of money and I would not expect to be referred to the AA when I need assistance, their reputation is not good and this two and a half hour wait proved this reputation to be warranted. I phoned Land Rover Assist whilst waiting as the AA kept pushing the time out and they were just not bothered. The AA representative who finally attended said he would log the complaint and someone from Land Rover Assist would ring me within 24 hours. Guess what? They didn't ring. Big Surprise? Not really. During this rental period, I was actually quite warming to this car and I was considering looking at a potential purchase. Although the fault encountered on this occasion depicts exceptionally bad quality control, I may have considered it to be an isolated incident in my considerations. Ironic then that the reason this manufacturer is most definitely off my potential purchase list now is my experience of how you get treated when you need assistance in a brand new car!",1,Land Rover

180,Kpax,Land Rover Assist et al....,en,2018-06-08T09:04:43Z,"6.30, in central London on a Friday at a petrol station, put wrong petrol in the car 15 mins from house on way to holiday. Call LAND ROVER assist. 2.5 hours later they send me AA (who are Land Rover Assist). Tries to start car at petrol station. Does not understand the error code on dash board. Refuses to make a call to find out from Land Rover.
Instead after making me spend £60 on diesel, 2 hours later, says it's a job for a AA mechanic. Mechanic turns up 2 hours afterwards to say the fuel assist did not do his job properly, left petrol in the engine and filter. Tries to remove petrol and recommends a recovery truck which won't come for 5 hours. By this time it was almost 1.00am. 
I ask why such long waits and he tells me that I should have been told that there were long delays that day. I said, they didn't mention that, otherwise, I would have made alternative arrangements. He says he'll get a cab to take me home (15 mins away after midnight)
I call Land Rover Assist just before midnight to tell them that whatever happens, I can't miss my hols and it's a long drive. They then promise me a hire car in the morning, which will be delivered, I can use to drive to our hols. Assured that at 8.00am Thifty car rental will call. By this time we've missed the start of our hols.
At 7.00am, Land Rover Assist call and re-assure car rental and confirm car pick-up and would be taken to a garage (forget the name) near address of owner.
At 8.00am no car rental company called. I chase, and chase, and chase for a couple of hours. 
At around 11.00am I get a call from recovery to be told that the car started when picked up! I say, why didn't anyone tell me. I live 15 mins away. I ask where the car is and is at a non-descript garage in NW London (not a LR garage) over an hour away. I call Land Rover and they tell me the car should be at Land Rover. I say OK, but I was told that it would be taken to the nearest LR garage to the car's owner. They then arrange to pick the car up again and take tit o LR in Barnet (driven of course). By this time LR Barnet is closing.
Meanwhile, Thrifty eventually tries to reserve a car an hour away at around 12.30/ 13.00, but can't deliver it. They also mentioned that they received no message to hire a car on my behalf or have it delivered by LR! By this time, I made arrangements to hire a car on the street with my phone to try and save the 2nd day of my hols.
After hols, I call LR to complain of the service. First and continual response (i should say defence) is that it's not them it's AA! Anyway, I make a formal complaint on the grounds that: Fuel assist didn't do his job right - he left with fuel in the engine and filter. Fuel assist refused to find out the error code from LR. If LR/ AA Assist had warned prior of the delays at AA (Land Rover Assist), I would have made other arrangements than wait in hope. The car started during recovery at 5.00am, 15 mins away, and nobody informed us (could have saved a car rental!). We were promised a Car rental that didn't turn up and when it did, too late, and they wouldn't deliver. Car eventually started and wasn't informed. When I called the LR garage, the mechanic recommended in those cases to give car some time and error code will clear and car will eventually start! He said AA should know that.
About, a month later, LR call to tell me effectively, tough luck, it's not a warranty issue so it's all your problem and we can't do anything to help because it's AA (who are LR assist - confusing). She also said that I'm not entitled to a car rental in the those circumstances.
I reply, by saying that it wouldn't matter whether it was warranty or not, the service was absolutely shocking! If I was told I wasn't entitled a car instead of being promised one, I would have hired a car the previous night and saved a day of my hols. What she just told me, just made the situation even worse! Throughout the whole process, I wasn't properly informed. I could have made my own arrangements and got to my holiday.
In the end, no apology, defensive. She thought I was only interested in some compensation for the car hire or the fuel assist. It didn't occur to her that I was a LR driver and first and foremost I didn't want it to happen again and secondly, yes absolutely, I wasted a lot because of them. 
She explained the ball is in AA's court and had nothing to do with them and insisted again that anyway, I was not entitled to a rental car, so they would not refund my car rental!
In between, the whole process, the delays, remises and screw ups were many, but I can't write it all.

The car is built but there is a problem with it...... watch this space I am worried what is going to turn up. Also Range Rover have still not got the car OLEV approved so you don’t get the govt subsidy for the fast charger yet until they do.

Garage was giving no updates at all, so a complains department needed to step in. But even then we had to keep ringing all the possible bells to be able at least to know what is going on.

As it was I had 2 children 4 and 7 in the car and my partner and a family friend came and removed them from the scene and took them home, I waited with the vehicle for repair with a view to continue my journey on my own.

After a few hours the assistance chap arrived and confirmed vehicle needed recovering and called recovery out.

I was taken to a cafe half a mile away to wait until recovery truck arrived and they where supposed to pick me up, they did not and I had to walk back to the car on there arrival.

The recovery truck eventually arrived and started removing the vehicle, at that point I then spoke to the chap taking the car and asked what happens to me?

Rightly so he stated that he could not take me as he was going to a depot.

I was then left at the side of the road in an unknown area with a suitcase, I then had to try and call Landrover assist number again and arrange transport which took a further 40 minutes to arrive a taxi, in the interim I had to wait in a bus shelter.

I was promised a replacement vehicle the next day to be provided at the location I was heading to.

Next day arrived no call, once again I had to call in to ask what is happening around lunchtime that day.

Eventually I was informed a car was found near and a taxi would take me to pick up the car this was around 3pm.

My main concern is being abandoned at the side of the road, plus I had to do all the chasing and be proactive to make this assistance work.

At no time did anyone sort anything out without chasing and all I got was they are busy and have not got to my issue yet on the list.

To me, abandoning a person in a strange place is not acceptable and to be honest is dangerous at best.

Not impressed at all, one why the car broke down in the first place 2.5 years old with 9k on the clock not good.

I have had over 12 new range rovers in my years of driving and this is the first time the vehicle has broken down and I expect a better service than this.

I have found Stratstone, Cheltenham to be absolute terrible in after sales service.  I have to wait for hours every time I go there.  Last time I arrived at 8.30 a.m. and wasn't even spoken to until 10 a.m.  It's never finished on time either.  They don't do everything they have the car booked in for and suggest bringing it back, which is a 1.5 hour journey each way!  On the last visit the brakes were worn, but they didn't notice until I raised the issue.  I had a terrible whining noise once in Cheltenham (2 miles from the dealership) and rang for help but they just said bring it in on Monday (2 days away).  I had to get it home and didn't know if I was causing damage by driving ... I had to get someone else to have a look at it.  They don't even get round to cleaning it.  I now find that when I purchased it they put the wrong model on the warranty I purchased, so my claim won't be accepted by the Insurance Company.  I rang Stratstone to change it.  The first time the call wasn't even answered.  The 2nd time the member of staff promised he was emailing the Insurers as we spoke ... he did not.  I've had to ring again today to be told only one person can change this and he's on holiday?!  The person in question will ring me back tomorrow ..... mmmm!  Let's see!!

189,David,This review is about the dealer not the vehicle,en,2018-05-22T09:56:43Z,"I would like to state from the outset that my new Range Rover Sport has performed faultlessly and I have been buying Landrovers since my first Discovery 300 TDI in 1994, apart from niggling issues I have probably owned some 18 new Landrovers the majority used off road and a Land Rover has never failed to get me home.....
I am not saying that Landrover does not have its issues and probably prospective customers reading these reviews would steer well clear of the brand......

Here is a copy of a Review that I did on Stratstone Newport when I picked up my new Range Rover Sport, I would also like to add that I have sent a copy to the CEO of TATA uk and Europe, despite promises from Stratstone customer services that the regional manager would be contacting me to discuss these issues, as of yet he has not bothered also the CEO of TATA has not bothered either, so it seems that poor customer care starts at the top with the CEO.
.
JLR take note you have a loyal customer base of clients that love your brand BUT LOYALTY ONLY GOES SO FAR......... YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED
Here is a copy of the review.....

It has taken me some time to think about this review and it gives me no pleasure whatsoever.
I recently bought a new Range Rover sport off Stratstone Newport, again and this is why I have used Stratsone and purchased some ten new Landover's off them, Four of them Range Rovers,  five of them from Newport, the deal that was presented after some negotiations with the Sales Manager and was acceptable, the vehicle was as I was told is located in Nottingham, I did say I do not want the vehicle driven to Newport and was assured by the salesman that I dealt with that it would be delivered by trailer.
The vehicle had to be registered by the end of March to save on the VED increase, I asked about the tax and was assured that it would be taxed for twelve months and a week.......

I went to the dealership to pick up my car !!!! Off came the covers to reveal my new car,

I think to cut this short I will list the problems.....
1. Front Number Plate not straight.
2. Rear number plate off centre.
3 Paint Chip on roof and front spoiler.
4.Vehicle not cleaned, inside glass not cleaned, trim inside marked.
5 Rear Load space protector which was ordered not fitted.
6 The vehicle had 67 miles on it, upon questioning the salesman and sales manager, they said it was delivery miles ??? also the car came from Cardiff not Nottingham ????
7. Rubber mats ordered were not in the vehicle.
8. The vehicle was Gardexed and the after market kit was not included, the warranty for the protection was not there.
9. The washer level was low.
10. The car was taxed from the first of the month, hence me losing a months tax.
11. Since my unhappy experience on picking up my supposedly new car, I have discovered damage on the Drivers side rear alloy wheel, but as I was pressured into signing the sales managers get out of jail free letter and upon paying some £70,000 for my new car I am going to have to pay for the damage caused by Stratstone.


Needless to say it was not the positive experience that it should be.
I was annoyed and said that I was rejecting the vehicle, The sales manager was OK about that but did say that if I rejected the car he would refund my deposit and call it a day, basically accept it or bugger off.
I went out for a walk to cool down when I returned he offered me a service plan which was some £800 on the condition that I signed a letter stating that I accept the vehicle with the faults and there was no comeback, again I will give you a service plan now bugger off.......
I accepted their offer and after modifying the letter to not sign my life away if I found other significant faults, they took the vehicle into the workshop and managed to straighten the front plate, top up the washer fluid and fit the load space protector.
I am sorry this is a long review but as I said it gives me no pleasure whatsoever to write this but, I am sorry but this Range Rover will be the last vehicle I will ever buy of Stratstone and I urge prospective customers to be careful and maybe deal with a garage that values your business.",1,Land Rover

After asking Land Rover, weather we where at fault or the tyre was at fault, but Land Rover did agree the alloys were at fault! After admitting this, they were still unhappy to help with this problem, they weren’t even happy to have a look at this problem even tho it wasn’t safe!

I purchased an autobiography from Guy Salmon Coventry 2 years ago. Since then it has been in 4 different dealerships for repairs. Each one is worst than the previous. Extra play in anti roll bar bushes make thudding noise when going over speed breakers. 
I have been told that the engineer can't find anything wrong with the car! or this is normal! even though it is covered under warranty no one seems to want to repair it. Dealership in Park Royal London kept the vehicle for over 3 weeks and it did not move from parking lot into workshop. (Tracker App shows any movement on my smart phone) Not only they did not repair the vehicle, It was wrongfully reported to Extended Warranty company that my vehicle was used for hire and reward. A claim later disproved by the warranty company's surveyor. 
Complaint was submitted in writing but no reply came. Second letter went to the dealership, the dealership head office and Land Rover the company. No one replied!.

Now the vehicle is in Lancaster Land Rover Milton Keynes for nearly FIVE WEEKS. When I call, receptionist answers the call after absolutely ages only to be asked to leave contact details and someone will call. But no one ever does. Don't get replies to emails either.

Eventually I had an email today to say and I quote ""I am very sorry for the lack of response and the delays on the phone.
The technician that has been involved in the car has now gone for the evening and so I don’t have a full report for you.  If I am honest I don’t believe that the workshop have had space to give your vehicle their full attention.""

On the 30th may I had to call customer relations to be told that the email means that it takes 3 working days to assign a case handler and another 3 working days to contact you.

I had to force him to ensure that I get a call on the same day.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Original complaint : ""I am sending this email to complaint about the appalling and sub standard customer service provided by Beedles Jaguar Watford. The list of incompetence by the staff and management are unlimited and I will try my best to explain.

The events :

1. My car was booked for 10th April 2018 for 2 issues it had. There were 2 different types of knocking sound.
2. Initially the car was supposed to be dropped off and a courtesy car was arranged. However atleast 2 weeks prior to the service day I called to inform that the courtesy car won’t be required and so was informed that one of the dealership staff will collect the car by 10: 00 am from my home address
3. On the 10th April 2018, the dealership staff never turned up. I called for a good 1 hour but no one answered the phones. Eventually I got through and was told there was a mistake and they will send someone. I had to wait until 2 :00 pm for the staff to come and collect my car, wasting precious time – Issue 1
4. On the same call I also informed the staff (Brendan) that a warning sign had come up on the 9th April to inform that AdBlue was LOW. He was also informed that I have a paid Service Plan which gives me unlimited AdBlue.
5. Before the car was returned to me after 3 days, I was called by Graham to inform what they had done. I asked him to check if AdBlue had been topped up and was told YES.
6. On driving the car I realised that 1 of the knocking sound was still not rectified and it selt like it was coming from the front of the car. On calling Graham, I was advised that only the rear discs/pads were replaced and I should give it some time to settle. Was also told that if the problem persists then I should call back.
7. On 19th April 2018, the AdBlue sign came up again, but this time saying “FILL”. I called on the 20th and spoke to Brendan (was told Graham had a half day)to inform of this and also to inform that the knocking sound was still there, I was told that they will have to check the job card and come back to me. When he did call me back he said there was no mention of the AdBlue on the job card and that he will send someone to collect the car and get the AdBlue topped up. I was also told that the dealership will top up the fuel someone will come back to me to regarding the knocking noise.
8. When my car was delivered with the AdBlue topped up, I was told by the driver that NO fuel was added – Issue 2
9. I informed the driver that he needs to ensure that Brendan calls me with the next steps regarding the noise.
10. Today we are on 25th April 2018 and I have had no calls from anyone at the dealership. – Issue 3

This is the level of incompetence that I have seen and frankly for the first time from any dealership.

201,MJR,Please please please DO NOT buy a Land…,en,2018-03-09T15:35:17Z,"Please please please DO NOT buy a Land Rover Discovery Sport if you value your sanity. I am at my wits end with Land Rover and the dealerships. Awful experience in every regard.

I have a 17 plate Discovery Sport HSE that has been back to the garage almost every month since i have owned it. 

Firstly the car went in due to the engine oil being out of spec which I was told by Peter Vardy service department was due to the type of driving that the car was being used for (don't remember being told that I couldn't drive the car in town or on motorways). It then had to go back in for a week to repair an annoying ticking noise coming from the driver B pillar area. This turned out to be a known issue caused by paint entering the small gap of the car shell where the door seal is. When the car body flexes during driving the entrapped paint causes the ticking noise. To repair this, the bodyshop has to drill out the spot welds on the car body to open the gap to remove the paint. The body is then spot welded again. Some bodyshops don't drill out the welds they just flex the gap with a screwdriver or similar until the paint is broken. A week later the car was returned and that annoying ticking was gone. They also tightened up various other interior panels and door trims that had all come slack. Unfortunately a few weeks later the ticking returned but this time from the drivers side and so it was returned to the garage again. 

We got the car back and all was quiet for a week or so, then another annoying rattle appeared, this time from the dash. Back into the dealership where this time I was informed that the air conditioning pipes were not fitted correctly in the factory and such were vibrating against the car chassis and would require some spacers to raise the piping. Sure enough back it came after a few days and that noise had gone. The car was fine for the next month or so until I took it to get it hand washed and polished. When the man was washing it, the drivers door handle cover came pinging off. He handed it to me telling me that this happens all the time with Discovery Sports.
I contacted the dealership yet again to book an appointment. The week before the car went in for repair there was very heavy rain where I live. We were out walking the dog and when returning to the car the powered boot started opening and closing all by itself. No key or boot buttons had been pressed, it had a mind of its own. A lot of door opening, key pressing and engine starting later the boot decided to close and stay closed. I contacted Land Rover assistance who duly came out the next morning to be told ""oh yeh I have seen this before but you need to book it into the dealership. It it probably water ingress to the electronic module"". So off it went with these 2 problems to be repaired. However I was told that they couldn't replicate the boot fault and as such the car was returned with a new door handle but with no repair done to the boot.
The boot problem seemed to be ok but this time there was significant rattle from under the car specifically if the engine was under load. Back it went to the dealership where this time I was informed that the exhaust heat shield had become slack and the offside drive shaft bearing end caps had worn through and needed to be replaced. The service technician who returned the car told me that again this is common and is because they aren't fitted properly in the factory.

The car was returned noise free which lasted about a week before the same noise appeared when the engine was under load. I made another appointment with the dealership for it to go back in to be repaired. Before this we once again had heavy rain and lo and behold the boot started opening and closing again by itself when you went to within a few meters of it with the key in your pocket. It is amazing that the 'Best 4 x 4 x far' can't actually be used in the rain unless you want the dog and shopping to fall out. 

I phoned up to add this issue to the other repair and asked to speak with the service manager. I asked him why the boot wasn't fixed the last time where I was told that if they have no proof of it happening how could I expect them to fix it. He told me do you want me to just replace parts until it is fixed. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I am waiting for the car to go in so no update on this at present.

The purchasing dealership weren't a bit better. Incompetent staff and lack of customer focus was evident from the offset. An issue with a replacement doorcard took 4 months to be resolved due to sending the wrong leather colour to start with then their inability to send the correct door card and collect the old one. Every time I phoned Farnell Bradford i was told that the previous member of staff that I spoke to 'No longer worked there' so kept getting a new contact and had to explain the whole saga again. I was told that they have had a lot of staffing issues over the last while which was to blame for all the problems. 

I really want to return this car but Land Rover are digging their heels in saying that they are repairing all the issues that I have had. If they had any decency they would accept this car back and admit that it is faulty. I don't know how many more times I can contact the dealership to have the car taken back in again.

Complained to Landrover who blamed the dealer - contacted the dealer who blamed Landrover..  A bunch of jokers I’m afraid.  Escalated as formal complaint but their complaints team is no better.  4 months later and no reply.  Avoid like a dose of thrush",1,Land Rover

Bought a brand new Freelander 2, have only used reputable Land Rover dealers for any work done (paying over the odds for it). Have for the last 18 months, having only drive 35,000 miles in it, had ongoing issues with the car in limp mode. Were told it was an injector that needed replacing, so did that, and still in limp mode, now told another injector needs replacing. So even though Land Rover admit even one shouldn`t go in a car 8 years old of that low mileage let alone 2, they suggest WE pay to have THEIR injectors tested in case they are faulty? Pile of rubbish, worst car we have ever had. Has cost us a fortune and still isn`t working, oh and the brake shattered among other issues we have had with it.

After chasing multiple times for a build date I was told in the first week of November they would not honour my order and my car would not be built.

No satisfactory reason was given, the colour I chose is now no longer available, they then started offering me alternative RR sport models they had in stock, due to the fact I could not wait to order a car from another company I said yes, even though it was not the spec I wanted and they were in boring colours, then I heard nothing back, this happened 4 times, each time they offered me an alternative car and I said yes, then I heard nothing and could not get an answer from JLR. 

I raised a complaint with Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), which took them 3 days to respond too! After 10 days of investigation they have not told me anything.

My last car was returned as per the lease, and now this car has not showed up I have ended up without a car.

214,Simon Walker,Land Rover still have appalling build quality and customer service,en,2017-10-24T16:08:59Z,"Over the past several years we have been fortunate enough to own ten Land / Range Rovers. Out of this number we have only had two reliable vehicles, always hoping the next one would be an improvement. 

Two Weeks ago we took delivery of our new car. Upon collection we noticed an unusual smell but put it down to being a new car. Having driven the car four times we had to pull over as there was significant white smoke coming from under the bonnet. Land Rover assist have tried to help but weren’t able to fix the issue. It appears that the exhaust was not correctly attached in the factory and as a result we have been driving around ( with two infants ) breathing in ‘raw’ diesel fumes. Hence build quality is a poor as ever and just not good enough on a new vehicle. 

I’m writing this report awaiting a loan vehicle at the local dealership where customer service is appalling. Having been waiting 40 minutes ( even though they were expecting us ) I decided to put the time to good use and warn people of the build quality and poor experience. We purchased a Range Rover for a reason and as suspexted this is not what you get when you require a loan vehicle. 

It’s sad to see that these products and customer service have not improved. If anything it’s worse than ever. Luckily we will be placing  an order with another manufacturer for the other Range Rover we were purchasing in the new year and have more reliable cars in the garage. I suspect this will be the start of many issues with this vehicle.",1,Land Rover

So far all 3 land rovers / Range Rovers have been brilliant vehicles and customer services and sales teams have been legendary 

I've had 
Freelander 2 - great on motorway and excellent of road used daily on and off road
Evoque - great about town and on the motorway less of road use but good when used
Rang Rover Sport - awesome cruiser comfy luxurious and very relaxing to drive

So far the  only niggle I've had was on the Evoque gearboxit wa the new 9 speed unit and was a bit bit slow to change gears, however the dealership took my car in updated the software as the gearbox was fixed I had a courtesy car for the afternoon whilst fix was happening and I was free to go with mended and valeted car 

Second issue was when the safety belt clip stopped working this was classed as an emergency ( it turned out my son some how got the safety belt clip jammed filled with chocolate buttons)  Land Rover sent an emergency response person to my home that evening so it would be safe to use the next day
